**Overview**

This website generates a random password given parameters inputted from the user.  The user chooses the following:

1. Length of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
2. Whether to include uppercase letters
3. Whether to include numbers
4. Whether to include special characters

The website also validates the user's input to ensure the values being entered are correct.

**Technologies Used**

Vanilla Javascript and CSS.  The app uses Javascript prompts to get information from the user.  The code uses string concatenation to create a string of possible password characters, then loops through the string selecting random indexes meeting the given password length.
